    "### Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Activity Chain Optimization (ACO) problem is a novel TSP variant that resembles the Generalizied Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (GTSPTW). The GTSP is also called the Set-TSP, or sometimes the Traveling Politician Problem - and is not to be confused with Green-TSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informal description of the ACO problem: given a map of pairwise times and costs of travel between locations that each offer the possibility for exactly one type of activity within a given time-window, and given a starting time and location, find the cheapest tour that visits all required activites exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary intended use-case: planning the daily commute of a person given well-defined preferences as well as temporal and spatial flexibility constraints. Might be most interesting as a trip-planning app for tourists."

    "Let $\\mathcal{G = (V, E)}$ be a directed graph, with location vertices $\\mathcal{V}=\\lbrace0,1,\\dots,n-1\\rbrace$ partitioned into $\\mathcal{A_0}=\\lbrace0\\rbrace,\\mathcal{A_1},\\dots,\\mathcal{A_{m-1}}$ disjunct non-empty activity clusters. Note that $m \\le n$ and $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N^+}$. Each directed edge $(i,j) \\in \\mathcal{E}$ corresponds to a cost $C_{ij}$ and a traveling time $T_{ij}$ between vertices $i$ and $j$ $(i,j \\in \\mathcal{V}, i \\ne j)$. It is both necessary and sufficient to define edges, costs and travel times between vertices belonging to different activity clusters only, i.e. $\\mathcal{E} = \\lbrace (i,j): i \\in \\mathcal{A_k}, j \\in \\mathcal{A_l}, k \\ne l\\rbrace$. Each location vertex $j$ is also assigned a time window $W_j = \\left[W^\\prime_j, W^{\\prime\\prime}_j\\right]$. The task is to find a finite-time minimum cost circuit starting from and ending at vertex $0$ (corresponding to a unique *\"home\"* activity and location), such that exactly one vertex of each activity cluster is visited and the arrival time $\\hat{t}_j$ at each visit either falls within the visited node's time window $W_j$ or precedes it. The recursive relation between $\\hat{t}_j$ arrival times (at node $j$) and $t_j$ ready times (ready for departure from node $j$) is as follows: \n",

    "If the real-world task involves time-consuming activities that have a nonzero duration $\\delta>0$ ($\\delta$ may or may not be uniform throughout different locations for the same activity), these durations can be integrated by adding them to the travel times $T_{ij}$ to their respective locations $(j)$. The time windows should also be adjusted to designate the earliest and latest finishing (ready) times for their respective activity by shifting $W_j$ by the appropriate $\\delta_j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the real-world task involves a multi-activity location $i$, it can be represented as a group of separate single-activity locations $i_1, i_2, \\dots$ with appropriate intra-group travel times $t_{i_{from}, i_{to}} = 0+\\delta_{i_{to}}$. Intra-group costs can be set to zero, or if the travel cost function includes a component unrelated to travel but related to the activity itself, a similar integration can be performed as in the case of travel times and activity durations. \n",

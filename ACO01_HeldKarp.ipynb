    "The Activity Chain Optimization (ACO) problem is a novel TSP variant that resembles the Generalizied Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (GTSPTW). The GTSP is also called the Set-TSP, or sometimes the Traveling Politician Problem - and is not to be confused with Green-TSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informal description of the ACO problem: given a map of pairwise times and costs of travel between locations that each offer the possibility for exactly one type of activity within a given time-window, and given a starting time and location, find the cheapest tour that visits all required activites exactly once.\n",

    "Let $\\mathcal{G = (V, E)}$ be a directed graph, with location vertices $\\mathcal{V}=\\lbrace0,1,\\dots,n-1\\rbrace$ partitioned into $\\mathcal{A_0}=\\lbrace0\\rbrace,\\mathcal{A_1},\\dots,\\mathcal{A_{m-1}}$ disjunct non-empty activity clusters. Note that $m \\le n$ and $m,n \\in \\mathbb{N^+}$. Each directed edge $(i,j) \\in \\mathcal{E}$ corresponds to a cost $C_{ij}$ and a traveling time $T_{ij}$ between vertices $i$ and $j$ $(i,j \\in \\mathcal{V}, i \\ne j)$. It is both necessary and sufficient to define edges, costs and travel times between vertices belonging to different activity clusters only, i.e. $\\mathcal{E} = \\lbrace (i,j): i \\in \\mathcal{A_k}, j \\in \\mathcal{A_l}, k \\ne l\\rbrace$. Each location vertex $j$ is also assigned a time window $W_j = \\left[W^\\prime_j, W^{\\prime\\prime}_j\\right]$. The task is to find a finite-time minimum cost circuit starting from and ending at vertex $0$ (corresponding to a unique *\"home\"* activity and location), such that exactly one vertex of each activity cluster is visited and the arrival time $\\hat{t}_j$ at each visit either falls within the visited node's time window $W_j$ or precedes it. The recursive relation between $\\hat{t}_j$ arrival times (at node $j$) and $t_j$ ready times (ready for departure from node $j$) is as follows: \n",

    "\n",
    "If the real-world task involves time-consuming activities that have a nonzero duration $\\delta>0$ ($\\delta$ may or may not be uniform throughout different locations for the same activity), these durations can be integrated by adding them to the travel times $T_{ij}$ to their respective locations $(j)$. The time windows should also be adjusted to designate the earliest and latest finishing (ready) times for their respective activity by shifting $W_j$ by the appropriate $\\delta_j$. \n",

Intra-group costs can be set to zero, or if the travel cost function includes a component unrelated to travel but related to the activity itself, a similar integration can be performed as in the case of travel times and activity durations. \n",

Then, if we were to exchange the non-minimal subsolution path across the affected activities to a minimal one, the length of the parent solution would either shrink or remain the same (due to slackness in waiting for the time-window), meaning it either wasn't minimal in the first place, or if it was minimal, there is another minimal solution without the offending non-minimal subpath. This argument can be repeated recursively until we find a minimal solution whose subsolutions are all minimal, which again is in contradiction with the initial assumption.

    "Since one of the optimal solutions certainly has subsolutions that are all optimal as well, we can find this specific optimal solution by construction that observes the invariant at every step. We will use a forward dynamic programming approach based on the Bellman-Held-Karp algorithm iteratively expanding the length of optimal Hamiltonian paths from $0$ (home) to $m-1$ (all) visited activities. At each stage we will consider and store in memory all possible optimal subsolutions of length $l$, one for each possible combination of: $\\binom{m-1}{l}$ non-home activities combined with one final destination location chosen from those $l$ activity clusters.  \n",
    "Let the notation for a subsolution be: $$\\mathcal{S^{(l)}_d}\\left(\\mathcal{A^{(l)}_z}\\right)$$ for a set of chosen activities (set of clusters) $\\mathcal{A^{(l)}_z} = \\lbrace \\mathcal{A_{k_1}, A_{k_2}, \\dots, A_{k_l}} \\rbrace, k_x \\in \\lbrace1,2,\\dots,m-1\\rbrace, k_i \\ne k_{j \\ne i}, z = \\lbrace1,2,\\dots,\\binom{m-1}{l}\\rbrace$, having $l=\\lbrace0,1,\\dots,m-1\\rbrace$, $\\mathcal{A^{(0)}_1} = \\lbrace\\rbrace$, length $|\\mathcal{S^{(l)}_d}(\\mathcal{A^{(l)}_z})| = |\\mathcal{A^{(l)}_z}| = l$ and final destination $d \\in \\mathcal{A_x} \\in \\mathcal{A^{(l)}_z}$. By the optimization invariant we know that it is possible to construct optimal subsolutions such that all $\\mathcal{S^{(l)}_d}\\left(\\mathcal{A^{(l)}_z}\\right)$ will be recursively made up of an optimal sub-subsolution $\\mathcal{S^{(l-1)}_{d^\\prime}\\left(\\mathcal{A^{(l)}_z} \\setminus \\mathcal{A_{[d]}}\\right)}$ plus a last step that leads from $d^\\prime$ to location and activity $d \\in \\mathcal{A_{[d]}}$. That is, forward construction is possible by checking all the previous stage's (one step shorter) optimal subsolutions that do not yet contain the desired destination's activity but already contain all other required activities, extending them with the last step to destination and taking the minimum among all extended candidates. Once the growing optimal subsolutions reach the maximum length of $m-1$ steps, there will be $n-1$ such subsolutions with all activities selected and finishing destinations in each of the $n-1$ non-home vertices. The only thing that remains is to check these $n-1$ optimal subsolutions by extending their paths to return to the starting location (thus becoming circuits) and taking the minimum cost finite-time extended candidate as a final optimal solution.\n",
